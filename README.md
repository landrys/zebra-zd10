#  Zebra-ZD10 Locally Attached Label Printer Setup 
  

## Procedure
   * Install your drivers for the printer. I did include some downloaded content but this should already be done as the printers are working.
   * Follow procedure to install Browserprint on windows. See included zebra-browser-print-user-guide-v1-3-en-us.pdf
    (This is basically "The Daemon" used to communicate with the printer via http to print without prompting)

## Browser Print 
  I included the download in this shared directory but if you need to get it yourself use link below. Be sure to select the one for Windows.
